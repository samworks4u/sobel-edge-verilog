# Sobel Edge Detection using Verilog (Vivado)
Verilog implementation of Sobel edge detection

This project implements a Sobel edge detection filter in **Verilog HDL**, designed to process grayscale image data and highlight edges using the Sobel operator. The project is targeted for simulation and FPGA implementation using **Xilinx Vivado**.

## ðŸ“· What is Sobel Edge Detection?

Sobel filtering is used in image processing to detect edges by calculating the gradient of image intensity. It uses two 3Ã—3 kernels (Gx and Gy) to compute horizontal and vertical edges, and combines them for edge magnitude.
